                           According to Brooker, the fourth series has even more variety in the episodes than in previous series. Brooker says that there is "some more hope" in the series, crediting this to the fact that writing began in July 2016 and continued throughout the 2016 U.S. election, and "I genuinely thought, I don't know what state the world's going to be in by the time these [episodes] appear, and I don't know how much appetite there will be for nothing but bleak nihilism."
                           In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror. Filming for the fourth series concluded in June 2017. The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles. In September 2017, two photos from the fourth series were released. Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for each episode in the fourth series of the series, referred to as the "13 Days of Black Mirror",concluding on 6 December 2017 with the announcement of the release date. All six episodes were released to Netflix on 29 December 2017
